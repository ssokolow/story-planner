Idea for how to detect when to jump focus to the next section on Up/Down keypress:
1. Get the current caret position via the selection API
2. Get a selection object for the end of the object
3. Check whether they have the same top/bottom edge on their Range.prototype.getClientRects()

If I also need it for textareas and it doesn't work for them, look into "create
a mirror" as an alternative way, based on getting info on soft word-wrap:

document.execCommand('defaultParagraphSeparator', false, 'p');

Potentially useful components:
- https://github.com/felixhayashi/TW5-TiddlyMap
  (Does this meet my needs for comfortably concept-mapping supporting details?)
- http://gitgraphjs.com/
  (Would it be helpful to offer this as a way to visualize how groups of
   characrers meet and separate as scenes progress?)

Ideas for consideration:
- Provide a tool for cutting scene blocks in two.
- The scroll position should be tethered to a point within the document so that
  fiddling with the hide/show controls can't lose your place.
- Your place should be kept when switching between narrative and timeline view.
- The selector header should be be fixed at the top so you don't have to scroll
  to the top to hide/show things.
- It should apply "sticky" behaviour to the current section header so you don't
  need to scroll to figure out which chapter you're currently looking at.
- Support real-time collaborative editing as an option.
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table
- Any analyses which are unsuitable for as-you-type application should be
  applicable with a single press of a "check for issues" button.
  - Detect spots in the story where, after they've been introduced, a
    particular subplot or character spends an unusual amount of story time
    without being touched on. (ie. statistically analyze the smooth weaving
    of subplots.)
  - Detect odd numbers of double-quotes or smart quotes (single or
    double) which don't pair up properly.
- Suggest that users add a `TODO` tag and provide an option for showing *only*
  sections which match said tag. Then it becomes really easy to leave notes
  for oneself and get a listing of what remains.
  - I still eventually want explicit support for inline TODO elements, though.
    (Because that'll allow them to be hidden/shown on export as an option.)
  - Maybe a "Note" element that you can type TODO: into would do?

Dark UIs are ill-advised for this kind of project, so I'll wait until I'm ready
to just offer FocusWriter-style full-blown custom theming.

I just thought of another idea for the story tool that I wanted your opinions on.
For the "note cards" that you can quickly pull up and dismiss while writing, if I
allow the author to enter a bunch of concise "Name: Value" pairs above the freeform
text, it'd make it possible for an author to request a comparison chart between
characters, where each column is a character and each row is a field being compared.
The part I'd still need to refine is how best to ensure consistency in fields names
so they all show up as the same row when appropriate while still being convenient
to work with.
