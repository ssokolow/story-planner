Potentially useful components:
- https://github.com/felixhayashi/TW5-TiddlyMap
  (Does this meet my needs for comfortably concept-mapping supporting details?)
- http://gitgraphjs.com/
  (Would it be helpful to offer this as a way to visualize how groups of
   characrers meet and separate as scenes progress?)

Ideas for consideration:
- Provide a tool for cutting scene blocks in two.
- The scroll position should be tethered to a point within the document so that
  fiddling with the hide/show controls can't lose your place.
- Your place should be kept when switching between narrative and timeline view.
- The selector header should be be fixed at the top so you don't have to scroll
  to the top to hide/show things.
- It should apply "sticky" behaviour to the current section header so you don't
  need to scroll to figure out which chapter you're currently looking at.
- Support real-time collaborative editing as an option.

- Any analyses which are unsuitable for as-you-type application should be
  applicable with a single press of a "check for issues" button.
  - Detect spots in the story where, after they've been introduced,  a particular
    subplot or character spends an unusual amount of story time without being
    touched on. (ie. statistically analyze the smooth weaving of subplots.)
