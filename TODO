Potentially useful components:

Ideas for consideration:
- The scroll position should be tethered to a point within the document so that
  fiddling with the hide/show controls can't lose your place.
- The selector header should be be fixed at the top so you don't have to scroll
  to the top to hide/show things.
- It should apply "sticky" behaviour to the current section header so you don't
  need to scroll to figure out which chapter you're currently looking at.
