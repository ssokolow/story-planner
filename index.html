    <dd><ul>
        <li>If a user doesn't use a given feature, its existence shouldn't be a
          burden on the UI elements and interaction flows they <em>do</em>
          use.</li>
        <li>The primary goal is to <em>use</em> your notes, not to get carried
          away with organizing them. Don't forget that.</li>
        <li>Don't just pile together desired features. Consider workflows and
          design the UI to streamline them.</li>
        <li>Despite being minimalist, the UI must be discoverable.</li>
        <li>Deviate from common conventions only with considered reason.</li>
      </ul>
      </dd>
    <dt>Progress</dt>
    <dd><p>An <a href="mockup/index.html">interactive concept mockup</a> which
      you may experiment with, and some un-published progress on translating
      it to a functioning Django-based prototype
      (<a href="screenshot_2019-10-04.png">screenshot</a>)
      before dogfooding and iterating on the design.
      (<a href="https://github.com/ssokolow/story-planner/issues">Feedback welcome</a>)</p>
      <p>The Django prototype also features a
        <a href="screenshot_2019-10-04_2.png">distraction-free view mode</a>
        which is key to the goal of not burdening users with the existence
        of features they don't use.</p>
      <p>It is quite literally the same page as the normal mode, but with
        different CSS rules active. The intent being to shape my conception of
        the interface into something powerful and well-suited to
        keyboard-centric writing activities but still looking good and feeling
        natural for a more traditional mouse-centric look and feel.</p>

    <dt>Known Competitors</dt>
    <dd><p>To date, I have not found any tool that follows the design
        philosophy that I'm trying to embody and all of the closest ones
        fail the "is it free so I can convince fanfiction authors to try it?"
        test.</p>
      <p>However, nothing exists in a vacuum, so here is an overview of the
        prior art I have encountered, in the order I encountered it:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><a href="http://www.writerscafe.co.uk/">Anthemion Writer's Café</a></dt>
        <dd><p>Back in the early 2000s, the precursor product to this
            (StoryLines 1.x) was my inspiration for this project.</p>
          <p>While I thought the overall effect of the timeline widget was
            cool, I lacked the vocabulary to call it "counter-productively
            skeuomorphic", and could only say that I didn't like the way it
            precluded putting a useful amount of text in each note card
            and that something just felt unsatisfying about horizontal being
            the primary scrolling direction on a desktop application.</p>
          <p>If StoryLines 2.x (which is part of Writer's Café) works for you,
            that's good, but I'd never be satisfied with that design without
            the ability to zoom and pan as naturally as you can with a real
            corkboard and a pair of legs. That's what I mean by
            counter-productively skeuomorphic. It chases a UI paradigm that
            it's not technically possible to properly
            implement with current hardware.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a> (Free)</dt>
        <dd>While it's much less a total document production aid and more
          a semantic word processor, LyX <em>was</em> my inspiration for various
          features related to writing rather than planning.

          <p>Examples include the semi-automatic generation of an outline,
            the merits to a <abbr title="What You See Is What You Mean"
              >WYSIWYM</abbr> approach to text composition (ie. font changes
            should indicate semantic rather than presentational details), and
            enforcing semantic-ness by discarding repeated presses of the Enter
            key or Spacebar while displaying an explanatory message in the
            status bar.</p>
          <p>If nothing else, in this day and age of online publication,
            WYSIWYG is an illusion. You can't control the screen size of the
            reader's chosen device and you may be posting on a site which
            only gives you a restricted subset of semantic markup and
            imposes its own theme on your work, so why not just focus on
            the semantics to begin with, trust the browser to be smart enough
            to lay it out "well enough", and avoid getting mired in
            tweaking trivial presentation details?</p>
          <p>If you really need to get the typesetting and other presentation
            details just perfect, that's something for after the composition
            is done anyway.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="https://gottcode.org/focuswriter/">FocusWriter</a> (Free)</dt>
        <dd>FocusWriter is a distraction-free writing tool. However, it is
          unlike other such tools in that it recognizes that features exist
          for a reason.
          <p>I was introduced to it by an article named <a
               href="https://writingonlinux.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/focuswriter-and-why-i-now-despise-writeroom/"
               >FocusWriter and how I came to despise WriteRoom</a> and it
             helped to shape my conception of what a distraction-free writing
             option could be in a more featureful system.</p>
          <p>While it <em>is</em> primarily a rich text editor, it is notable
            in offering a primitive semi-automatic outliner, a tracker for
            daily writing goals, timers, advanced "word count" support,
            and support for saved sessions, all accessed via panels which
            auto-hide at the edges of the screen when in fullscreen mode.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview">Scrivener</a></dt>
        <dd><p>I was made aware of this apparently popular tool after the initial
          draft of my design.</p>
          <p>There's no Linux version and I've actively tried to avoid looking
            too much into it to avoid copying ideas, but the tiny screenshots
            and described features from the site's landing page suggest that my
            experimentation with my developing prototype is driving me in a
            similar direction.</p>
          <p>(eg. A tool that replaces your word processor and aids out-of-order
            writing, includes integrated storage for reference materials, and
            can export to ready-to-upload formats.)</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.campfiretechnology.com/">Campfire</a></dt>
        <dd><p>I discovered this tool via a sponsorship on a
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBtvS5yhTA8">Shadiversity video</a>
            I watched on September 29th, 2019.</p>
          <p>The download version doesn't work on Linux and I'm not interested
            in Software as a Service but there are three things I can comment on
            based on the preview in the sponsorship blurb:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>I get the impression it probably isn't the easiest interface
                to navigate with both hands on the keyboard.</p></li>
            <li><p>Maybe it's just because I'm an aspie, but their character bio
              view worries me. It feels like something where you could spend
              far too much time distracting yourself from your content to focus
              on customizing fine presentation details your readers will never
              see.</p>

              <p>Until user testing has proven otherwise, I'll continue to
                assert that a simple wiki page (markup or WYSIWYG) with
                support for using comfortable definition list markup to specify
                key-value pairs is closer to the ideal for
                <abbr title="Return on Investment">ROI</abbr>.</p>
              <p>However, it does prompt me to think more deeply on how best
                to allow the author to specify a template so they don't miss
                certain fields in certain bio cards. At the time, all I had
                was ensuring support for in-place editing in my plans for a
                comparison matrix which, by its very nature as a table, shows
                empty cells for missing data. (The comparison matrix originally
                being intended for checking whether you're making your
                characters too similar.)</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Their ad deprived me of the ability to come up with the idea
                of integrated mapping on my own schedule, if it proved fitting.</p>

              <p>(In order to keep the UI focused and friendly for someone who
              isn't yet sold on the idea of using more than a text editor and
              their own memory, I'm being conservative about planning for new
              features. See also
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">
                <abbr title="You aren't gonna need it">YAGNI</abbr></a>.)</p></li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>I don't intend to consider investigating my competitors more deeply until
      my own original experimentation for how to design a good UI starts to
      run dry.</p>
    <p>However, to do my due diligence, I did skim through the options
      listed on <a href="https://alternativeto.net/">alternativeTo.net</a> after
      discovering Campfire. Not one of the free options had the design philosophy
      I'm aiming for. At the closest, they still looked more like programmer's
      text editors with distraction-free modes sometimes bolted on.</p>
